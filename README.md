# Logistic-Regression-Algorithm
This repository implements the machine learning classificatio algorithm of Logisitic Regression from scratch.
The model is trained to for a mult-class classification task. 
#Acknowledgement:
#The Machine Learning course provided by prof. Adnrew Ng on Coursera helped the author to understand how to implement the Logistic Regression algorithm.
